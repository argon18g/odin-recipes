    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Waffle, crisp raised cake baked in a waffle iron, a hinged metal griddle with a honeycombed or fancifully engraved surface that allows a thin layer of batter to cook evenly and crisply. Baking powder is the typical leavening in American waffles, and yeast waffles are eaten in Belgium and France.</p>
    <p>In the United States and Canada, waffles are a popular breakfast food, often topped with butter and maple syrup or fruit preserves. Waffles also can serve as a base for savoury mixtures such as seafood or poultry in sauce. In Belgium, waffles are a popular snack food. They are mentioned in French poems from as early as the 12th century, when they were sold as street food at fairs and religious festivals.</p>
